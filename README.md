# Casino Bot

A professional, feature-rich economy and gambling bot built with TypeScript, Discord.js, and Prisma. This bot offers a comprehensive financial system, interactive casino games, and an advanced hierarchical permission system for granular server control.

## Overview

This project provides a complete ecosystem for Discord servers looking to engage members through economy and gaming. It features a per-server economy (money is not shared globally), customizable shops, dynamic jobs, and a robust banking system with loans and credit scores.

## Key Features

### Economy System
- **Banking**: Deposit and withdraw funds. Earn interest on deposits.
- **Credit System**: Dynamic credit scores affect loan eligibility and interest rates.
- **Loans**: Automated loan system with repayment tracking and penalties for defaults.
- **Shop & Inventory**: Server admins can create custom shop items. Users can buy, sell, and trade items.
- **Marketplace**: User-to-user black market for selling rare items.
- **Jobs**: Dynamic income commands (work, crime, etc.) with configurable payouts and cooldowns.

### Casino Games
- **Blackjack**: Classic card game with hit, stand, and double down mechanics.
- **Roulette**: Bet on colors, numbers, or odd/even.
- **Slots**: Visual slot machine with customizable winning combinations.
- **Coinflip**: Simple high-stakes betting.

### Administration & Permissions
- **Hierarchical System**: Multilayered permissions (Admin > User Permissions > Channel Overrides).
- **Casino Channels**: Whitelist specific channels for bot interaction.
- **Audit Logging**: Detailed logs for all administrative actions, bans, and configuration changes.
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Configure interest rates, starting balances, and taxes directly from Discord.
